Once upon a time, there was a crow.
He was very thirsty.
He flew in search of water, however he could not find water anywhere.
Then, he saw a pitcher of water.
He saw the pebbles lying nearby.
He hit upon a plan.
He brought the pebbles one by one and dropped into the pitcher.
The water rose up.
He drank water and flew away.
Where there is a will, there is a way.
