Once upon a time, there was a fox.
He was very hungry.
He spied a beautiful bunch of grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree.
The grapes hung from a high branch and the fox had to jump for it.
He jumped but missed it by a long way.
Then he tried again and again but could not succeeded to reach.
Finally he walked away saying,"The grapes are sour".
You often hate what you can't have.
