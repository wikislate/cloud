Long ago, the mice had a meeting to consider what majors they could take to outwit the cat.
Some said this and some said that, but at last a mouse got up and said he had a proposal to make
which he thought would meet the case.
He said "you will agree that our chief danger is in the sly and treacherous manner in which the enemy approaches us."
Now if we could recieve some signal of approach, we could easily escape from her.
I propose that a small bell be procured and attest around the neck of cat.
